# IntegrationProject
 This is a project that integrates everything that I've learned from COP 1500, Intro to Computer Science.
 This program is a dice rolling game. The user and other player rolls a dice.
 Your original roll is either subtracted, divided, floor division,
 or squared depending on the users choice. The results are judged by who
 has the largest number after the initial roll and the math applied. Winner
 of the round gets two points, the loser gets no points, and a tie gives no
 points as well. Either roll again or exit the game.
